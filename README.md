## Introduction

The Garage Door Controller project is designed to showcase the capabilities of the 8051 microcontroller in controlling a garage door. It includes both hardware simulation in Proteus and source code in Keil uVision.

## Features

- Simulated garage door operation.
- Code written in C for 8051 microcontroller.
- Proteus simulation file provided.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/) - for hardware simulation.
- [Keil uVision](https://www.keil.com/) - for editing and compiling the code.
- 8051 Microcontroller hardware or simulator.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GARAGE-DOOR-CONTROLLER-USING-8051.git
